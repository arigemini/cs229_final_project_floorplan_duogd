The corresponding report has been submitted on gradescope.

The file pix2pix_model_final.py can be run to train and output a model.

We can then run prediction.py to evaluate trained models on a test dataset i.e. generate floor plans that we can visually inspect as well as calculate metrics such as Frechet Inception Distance, to asses the quality of generated images.

The dataset used for training and testing is quite large and can be made available upon request. Feel free to contact us at:
